# Code of Conduct

## Keep It Simple

I want this project to be a place where people can contribute without drama. Here's what I expect from contributors:

## What I Expect

- **Be respectful** in discussions and code reviews
- **Stay on topic** - keep conversations focused on the project
- **Help newcomers** when they have questions
- **Give useful feedback** that helps improve the code
- **Accept feedback** when others review your work

## What's Not Okay

- Personal attacks or insults
- Harassment of any kind
- Spam or off-topic posts
- Publishing someone's private information
- Being disruptive or trolling

## My Responsibilities

As the maintainer, I'll:

- Keep discussions civil and productive
- Remove content that doesn't belong
- Ban users who repeatedly cause problems
- Make the final call on disputes

## When This Applies

This applies to all project spaces:

- GitHub issues and pull requests
- Code comments and commit messages
- Any project-related discussions

## Reporting Issues

If someone's being disruptive, open an issue, DM me on Discord, or email me directly. I'll handle it quickly and keep it confidential.

## Enforcement

If you break these rules, I might:

- Give you a warning
- Remove your comments
- Block you from the project
